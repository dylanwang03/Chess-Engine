# Chess-Engine

This project features a chess engine that employs the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient move selection. The engine is integrated into an interactive website, allowing users to play against the computer and experience a challenging game of chess.

Features
Minimax Algorithm: The core of the engine is built upon the minimax algorithm, which helps the computer make optimal moves by considering possible future moves and their outcomes.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: To enhance the efficiency of the minimax algorithm, the engine implements alpha-beta pruning. This technique eliminates branches of the game tree that do not need to be evaluated, reducing the number of nodes explored.

Interactive Website: The chess engine is integrated into an interactive website using primarily JavaScript. Users can play against the computer, make moves, and witness the engine's decision-making process.

Technology Stack
JavaScript: The main programming language used for the chess engine's logic and the interactive website.

HTML/CSS: The website's structure and styling are created using HTML and CSS.
